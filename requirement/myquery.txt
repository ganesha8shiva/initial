High Level Requirements
-----------------------

We are creating a web interface that will take imported files, and then allow the customer to download picksheets (based on imported information).  Pick Sheets once created can be marked as shipped.  

Login not required, this is a simple web app with limited functionality to work when their main system is unavailable.

Data Layout
-----------
Simple Data Layout - SQLite database is fine

PartRequest - mimic imported data 1 row per imported line.  Add unique id for pk joins.
PickSheet - Type (Fuel, Exhaust, etc), min CSN, max CSN, date printed, status - not imported, created from user interface.
PickSheetPart - Many to Many relationship...  PickSheet.id, PartRequest.id, Part # (Contains part #, for instance column Q for FuelTank, or just get from join to PartRequest)


Screens
-------
1) Import Screen
	- Upload a file (sample_data.txt) fixed width columns into a sqlite database.  Column specifications are in sample_data.xls 
	- Paste in textbox (same text format)
	- [Later Requirement] check an email account for the file, and import it automatically

   Q. we need to discuss how to seperate data in row which has no delimeter / seperator like space or ; or | (pipe)
   
   As you can see below row pick from sample text file
   1222791332GNFLGE54C63704652MM1581733 P*                               6CYL    6CYL    CMAGNA  22799015GMCHROM GMCHROM 12      9213       
   
   Should be break like 
   
      pvi          vin             csn       catalytic  pnbc590  muffler  pnbc592   spoiler   pnbc200 rfconsole	pnbc591	mirrorrgt	pnbc634	mirrorlft	pnbc636	modelyear	fueltank	pnbc210
   122279133 2GNFLGE54C6370465 2MM1581733      6CYL        ?      6CYL      ?       CMAGNA      ?     22799015       ?      GMCHROM       ?      GMCHROM       ?        12          9213     ? 
   
   Q. Can you plese throw some light on colums pnbc590, pnbc200,... etc
   
   ETA: 24 Hours / 3 Days ( 8 Hours per Day)
   
2) Overview/Status Screen
 	- List all imported rows and their status
		Add status column for (final steps coming but likely:  pending, printed, picked, shipped).   
      
      Q. Do I need to add column status in table like mentioned in attached excelsheet.
      
	- View Part Status
		For each part type, show how many pending requests there are and if there's enough available to make a picksheet (example 9 for fuel), have a link to create a pick sheet.

		A) Fuel       
		B) Exhaust
 		C) Console
		D) Left Mirror
		E) Right Mirror	
               
   ETA: 24 Hours / 3 Days (8 Hours per Day)
   
3) Print Pick Sheets
	- Pick sheets are defined by the type of part, and are a depiction of the physicaly layout of the parts to be shipped on the rack.
	- Current system pick sheets are shown in in sample_picksheet.pdf
	- Rows will be grouped into a picksheet based on the part type
	Example Pick Sheet 1:
		FUEL Part (column Q in import file, Page 1 of sample_picksheet.pdf).  
		Will be based off the the Fuel column of the next 9 rows (by CSN).  
		In a 3 column x 3 row table, print the CSNs in reverse order, and the specific part number (9223, 9213, etc)
	We will provide specific pick sheet information for each type, but basically they are all a table configuration X columns, Y rows, with Ascending or Descending order.   

	A) Fuel: 3 columns, 3 rows, filled from bottom row first, right to left.
	B) Exhaust: 1 column 8 slots, filled from top to bottom.   Both exhaust and catalytic converter are included on this pick sheet.   
	C) Console: 7 columns, 2 rows, filled from left to right.  
	D) Left Mirrors take two pages to print currently (48 slots, 12 rows and 4 columns), Filled in ascending order, vertically.  
	E) Right Mirrors - same logic as left.
	
   Q. Do we need to generated pdf for pick sheets ? 	
   Q. TBD (Note If researched is required from my end, hours pertaining it won't be count for bill

Pick Sheet Important Information:
	Start CSN
	End CSN
	Rack # (automatic field, that we will use the last Rack # for that part type, or let the user type it in).
	Individual Part #s.  
	Order of CSN will change from asc to desc depending on type of pick sheet.
	CSNs will always be picked in chronological order.
   
   Q. TBD
   
4) Workflow - manage pick sheets as picked, shipped, etc.
